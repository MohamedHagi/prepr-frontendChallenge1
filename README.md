# React Application - PreprLabs Clone

## Overview

Welcome to the PreprLabs Clone React application! This project aims to recreate the [PreprLabs](https://preprlabs.org/) page after login, focusing on providing a responsive design with support for both light and dark modes. The primary challenge involves implementing key click events and ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and browsers.

## Objective

The primary objective is to replicate the user interface and experience of the PreprLabs page, ensuring that users can easily access and interact with different sections such as challenges, labs, and projects. The application embraces modern web design principles, prioritizing responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions, providing an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Dark Mode**: Users can switch between light and dark modes to suit their preferences. The dark mode enhances user experience, especially in low-light environments.

- **Interactive Elements**: Mouseover effects are implemented for a more engaging user interface. Key click events include the search bar functionality (with keyboard input support), menu expansion/collapse, and seamless view switching between challenges, labs, and projects.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The application is built using the React library, ensuring a modular and efficient component-based structure.

- **CSS**: Styling is achieved using CSS, providing a clean and visually appealing layout.
